# [Project 1] 2D homography computation with ORB and RANSAC
1. Choose two images
2. compute ORB keypoint and descriptors (opencv)
3. apply Bruteforce matching with Hamming distance (opencv)
4. implement RANSAC algorithm to compute the homography matrix. (DIY)
5. prepare a panorama image of larger size (DIY)
6. warp two images to the panorama image using the homography matrix (DIY)

Submit:
 1. source code (python or C/C++) and the two source images and the result image
 2. a report describing your work.

# 중간시험과제: automatic stitching of two images
1. take two views in Sogang University.
2. develop a ORB + Ransac + homography algorithm to create a panorama image from the two inputs.
3. apply the algorithm to get a result.

4. take another set of two views in Sogang University
5. produce output

Submit: link to your github repository 
- it must contain a pdf report describint the problem, algorithm, experimental results
- and the source code
- Readme.md file must be presented. It should be a short version of the report.

Some students will be presenting the report during the class.
